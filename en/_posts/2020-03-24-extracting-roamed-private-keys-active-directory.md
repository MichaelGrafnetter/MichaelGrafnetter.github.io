One of&nbsp;the&nbsp;lesser known features of&nbsp;Active Directory (AD) is&nbsp;called **Credential Roaming**. When&nbsp;enabled, it&nbsp;synchronizes DPAPI Master Keys, user certificates (including the&nbsp;corresponding private keys) and&nbsp;even&nbsp;saved passwords between computers. These credentials can&nbsp;easily be&nbsp;extracted from&nbsp;Active Directory database. If&nbsp;you want to&nbsp;learn more on this&nbsp;topic, be&nbsp;sure to&nbsp;read my [\#CQLabs article](https://cqureacademy.com/blog/extracting-roamed-private-keys).
