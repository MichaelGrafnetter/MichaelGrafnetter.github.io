One of the lesser known features of Active Directory (AD) is called **Credential Roaming**.

These credentials can easily be extracted from Active Directory database. If you want to learn more on this topic, be sure to read my [\#CQLabs article](https://cqureacademy.com/blog/extracting-roamed-private-keys).
