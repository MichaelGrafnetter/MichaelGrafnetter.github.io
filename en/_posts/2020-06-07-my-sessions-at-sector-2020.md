![SecTor Logo](https://www.dsinternals.com/wp-content/uploads/sector.png)I will be delivering 2 tech talks at this year’s [SecTor](https://sector.ca/) conference in Canada:

- [Active Directory Database Security](https://sector.ca/sessions/active-directory-database-security/)
- [Getting Rid of Passwords with FIDO2 and W3C WebAuthn](https://sector.ca/sessions/getting-rid-of-passwords-with-fido2-and-w3c-webauthn/)

Unfortunately, it is still unclear whether the conference will need to be moved online.
