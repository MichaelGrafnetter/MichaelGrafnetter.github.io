I will be hosting a webinar titled “**PowerShell in the Land of DevOps**” on Monday, **June 29, 2020,** 10:00 AM – 11:30 AM CEST. We will explore features of PowerShell that can be used to automate the deployment of server applications, validate the infrastructure configuration against a well-defined baseline, and orchestrate software tests with GitHub or Azure DevOps.
