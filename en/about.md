![Michael Grafnetter Profile Picture](/assets/images/profile_picture.jpg){: style="float: left; margin-right: 10px"}

My name is&nbsp;Michael Grafnetter and&nbsp;I&nbsp;currently work at&nbsp;[SpecterOps](https://specterops.io/).

![Microsoft MVP Logo](/assets/images/microsoft_mvp.png){: style="float: right; margin-left: 10px"} I&nbsp;enjoy doing Active Directory [security research](/en/projects/), about which&nbsp;I&nbsp;then&nbsp;regularly give public [tech talks](/en/videos/) at&nbsp;various conferences and&nbsp;events. For&nbsp;these community activities, I&nbsp;have repeatedly been given the&nbsp;[MVP award](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/PublicProfile/5001919?fullName=Michael%20Grafnetter) by&nbsp;Microsoft.

The&nbsp;information and&nbsp;views presented in&nbsp;this&nbsp;blog are&nbsp;my own and&nbsp;do&nbsp;not reflect the&nbsp;official position of&nbsp;my employer.
Moreover, many of&nbsp;the&nbsp;blog posts have been written a&nbsp;long time ago and&nbsp;thus might be&nbsp;outdated.
