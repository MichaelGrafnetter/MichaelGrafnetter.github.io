My name is Michael Grafnetter and&nbsp;I&nbsp;am an InfoSec professional (Active Directory security audits, penetration tests and&nbsp;trainings).
I&nbsp;mainly work with [CQURE](https://cqure.pl/), [Gopas](https://www.gopas.cz/) and&nbsp;[Mainstream Technologies](https://www.mainstream.cz/).

The&nbsp;information and&nbsp;views presented in&nbsp;this blog are my own and&nbsp;do&nbsp;not reflect the&nbsp;official position of&nbsp;companies I&nbsp;work with. 
Moreover, some most of&nbsp;the blog posts have been written a&nbsp;long time ago and&nbsp;thus might be outdated.
